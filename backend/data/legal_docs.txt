1. Core Legal Framework

Main modern real-estate law
	•	Real Estate Ownership Law No. 13 of 2019
	•	Consolidates and replaces many older land laws (including the Ottoman Land Code of 1858).
	•	Regulates ownership, transfer, and registration of land and buildings in Jordan.
	•	All real estate transactions must be registered at the Department of Lands and Survey (DLS) to be legally valid. Unregistered contracts have no legal effect.

Key related laws
	•	Landlords and Tenants Law No. 11 of 1994, as amended by Law No. 14 of 2013
Governs rental contracts, landlord–tenant relations, and eviction rules.
	•	Leasing and Selling Immovable Assets to Non-Jordanians Law No. 47 of 2006
Sets conditions and restrictions for foreign (non-Jordanian) ownership and leasing of real estate.
	•	Economic Boycott Law No. 11 of 1995
Prohibits dealing in property with nationals of certain “hostile” states.
	•	Disposal of Immovable Assets by Juristic Persons Law No. 61 of 1953
Regulates property ownership by companies (juristic persons) and ensures transactions match their permitted business activities.
	•	Jordanian Civil Code No. 43 of 1976
	•	Defines original real rights (ownership, disposition, usufruct, residence, etc.).
	•	Applies as a fallback for leases and property issues not covered in special laws.


2. Constitutional Protection of Property
	•	Article 6 (Constitution 1952)
	•	All Jordanians are equal before the law.
	•	State must provide work, education, tranquility, and equal opportunity.
	•	Article 11
	•	Private property may only be expropriated for public benefit and with fair compensation, as defined by law.
	•	Article 12
	•	No forced loans or confiscation of movable or immovable property except according to law.

These articles guarantee private ownership and set strict conditions for expropriation.


3. Types of Property: Movable vs Immovable

Definition
	•	Immovable property: Anything fixed in place that cannot be moved without damage or deformation (land, buildings, etc.).
	•	Movable property: Everything else.

Movable property – ownership rules
	•	Possession is the key:
	•	If someone permissibly possesses an unowned movable intending to own it, they can become its owner.
	•	The general rule: possession is strong evidence of ownership.
	•	Courts often treat the possessor of a movable item as the owner unless proven otherwise.

Immovable property – ownership rules
	•	Immovable property (land/buildings) is subject to formal procedures:
	•	Ownership must be proven and transferred through the official land registration system.
	•	Requirements vary by location, type, size, and use of the land.
	•	In “settled” areas, transactions not registered at the DLS are null and void.


4. Buying Real Estate in Jordan

4.1 Due diligence and pre-sale contracts
	•	Buyer or lawyer should:
	•	Obtain the title deed (Sanad al-Milkiya) from DLS.
	•	Check for encumbrances (mortgages, disputes, easements).
	•	After due diligence:
	•	Parties usually sign a preliminary sale agreement specifying:
	•	Price
	•	Payment schedule
	•	Timeline
	•	Conditions and penalties
	•	This secures the deal while approvals and financing are completed.

4.2 Government approvals
	•	Jordanian citizens
	•	No special approval beyond normal DLS registration.
	•	Foreign individuals (non-Jordanians)
	•	Must obtain prior approval from the Ministry of Interior (and sometimes higher authorities).
	•	Typical steps:
	•	DLS coordinates with Ministry of Interior to approve the transaction.
	•	Large or strategically located properties may require approval from:
	•	Minister of Finance
	•	Council of Ministers (Cabinet)
	•	Reciprocity condition:
	•	Foreign buyer’s country must allow Jordanians to own property there.
	•	Arab nationals are generally exempt from reciprocity.
	•	Foreign companies
	•	Can own property if:
	•	It is consistent with their stated business objectives.
	•	It is needed for their licensed activities in Jordan.
	•	Foreign-majority companies registered in Jordan can be treated similarly to Jordanian entities for land ownership purposes, depending on the law.

4.3 Ownership restrictions for foreigners
For approved foreign buyers:
	•	Typically allowed:
	•	One residence for personal use.
	•	Additional properties for investment, subject to limits.
	•	Caps and conditions
	•	Limits on number and size of properties.
	•	Use of property must match the stated purpose (residential, commercial, etc.).
	•	Development timeline
	•	If buying vacant land or an unfinished project:
	•	Usually must develop within:
	•	3 years for residential projects.
	•	5 years for other (e.g. commercial) projects.
	•	One extension may be allowed.
	•	Failure to develop:
	•	Leads to penalties (e.g. about 5% of market value per year, capped over several years).
	•	Can result in forced sale by auction.
	•	Lock-in period
	•	Foreign buyers generally cannot resell or transfer property for:
	•	3 years (residential),
	•	5 years (other types).
	•	This restriction is recorded as an encumbrance on the title.
	•	Purpose: prevent speculative flipping.
	•	Location bans / sensitive areas
	•	Foreigners are prohibited from owning in:
	•	Border zones.
	•	Archaeological or historic sites (e.g. core Petra area).
	•	Cabinet can designate additional restricted areas for national interest.
	•	Share transfers in land-owning companies
	•	Transfer of company shares (in a company that owns land) is not treated as a land transfer.
	•	This generally avoids land transfer tax, but normal corporate/income taxes still apply.

4.4 Finalizing a purchase
	•	After approvals:
	•	Buyer pays purchase price (often using a mortgage: typical local financing ~5–25 years, up to ~80% of value).
	•	Seller and buyer complete transfer at DLS.
	•	Buyer pays registration/transfer fees and taxes.
	•	DLS issues a new title deed in buyer’s name.
	•	Legal effect:
	•	Only registered sales at DLS transfer ownership.
	•	Private/unregistered contracts do not change legal title.

4.5 Freehold vs leasehold
	•	Default in Jordan: freehold
Buyer owns land and building outright in perpetuity.
	•	Leasehold:
	•	Used in special cases (religious trust lands, some state lands, special projects).
	•	Long-term leases (e.g. decades) instead of sale.
	•	Common in some industrial/tourism zones.

4.6 Local variation
	•	For most cities (Amman, Irbid, Zarqa, etc.):
	•	Process is the same: DLS office in governorate handles registration.
	•	Aqaba is a notable exception (special zone, see below).


5. Ownership Rights

5.1 Jordanian citizens
	•	Jordanian citizens and fully Jordanian-owned companies:
	•	Can own residential and commercial property without special permits.

11. Overall Observations & Recommendations (from the policy perspective)

Key observations
	1.	Constitution guarantees equal private ownership rights for all Jordanians and requires fair compensation for expropriation.
	2.	Movable property ownership is largely based on possession.
	3.	Immovable property ownership:
	•	Is highly formalized.
	•	Requires registration at DLS.
	•	Courts uniformly declare unregistered transfers in settled areas null and void.
	4.	Settlement procedures and deadlines may create barriers for poor people to assert or defend their land rights.
	5.	Women are often disadvantaged:
	•	Social pressure may force them to waive inheritance rights or sell below value.
	6.	Land settlement can be slow and complex, with multiple appeal levels.
	7.	Need for frequent and complete land settlements:
	•	Ownership in unsettled areas is less secure and valued lower.
	•	Completing the national Land Use Map is important for transparency and fair valuation.
	8.	State land delegation laws provide mechanisms to help the poor access land for housing or agriculture, but these mechanisms:
	•	Need more activation and awareness.
	•	Require support so people in poorer regions actually benefit.
	9.	Delegated land can be used as collateral for loans:
	•	Financial institutions should create programs enabling poor landholders to start small projects.
	10.	Housing and Urban Development Corporation:
	•	Provides a strong framework for delivering land and housing to poorer classes (e.g. free delegation of state lands to corporation and fee exemptions).
	11.	Government plans affecting land value:
	•	Must be handled with transparency and confidentiality:
	•	To prevent “insiders” from buying land cheaply before public announcements.
	•	To ensure fair opportunities for all citizens.

Policy recommendations (for context on poverty & property issues)
	1.	Speed up land settlement in all regions; simplify objection/appeal procedures, especially for the poor.
	2.	Raise awareness of property laws among poor communities so they:
	•	Use their legal rights.
	•	Avoid losing property through non-compliance or ignorance.
	3.	Improve transparency on government land-use plans and major projects to reduce exploitation by powerful actors.
	4.	Create specific safeguards for women and poor people in settlement and inheritance processes:
	•	Example: require independent valuation of property before any assignment of rights among heirs.
	5.	Encourage public and private initiatives that help the poor:
	•	Use their property or newly acquired state land effectively.
	•	Access credit and technical support to use land as a real asset for income generation.
